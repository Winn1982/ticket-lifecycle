I am going to login as "John" an IT support technician to assign the ticket to the correct department, give it a proper SLA, etc.

We opened the ticket and see the main page. We are going to be the person that updates the ticket as needed and will forward it to the correct department.

"John" has finished assigning the ticket where it should go. He changed the Priority,
	Department,
	SLA, and 
	Assigned To.

I logged in as "Jane" who works in the mobile banking department. The ticket showed up properly. We will work the ticket as Jane.

Jane worked the ticket and suspected it was due to an update, the update was uninstalled and everything was rolled-back and the vendor was notified.
